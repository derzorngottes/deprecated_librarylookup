#### Library Lookup ####

##### Note: this project is undergoing conversion from Jade to Handlebars/Bootstrap and should be considered in development at this time. #####

A basic library lookup app for programming books. Users can add, edit and remove books and authors.

#### Technologies ####

Implemented with Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Knex.

#### Implementation ####

My first pass at this project led to a lot of frustrations caused by the learning curve of jade templating, PostgreSQL, and join tables.

On my second pass, I converted the views files to Handlebars in order to relieve some of the data manipulation on the front end.
